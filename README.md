# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
### Summary
AutosRU's are having manufacturing issues with their newest prototype, the MechaCar. The Manufacturing team has asked for help determining issues they are facing in the manufacturing process. 

In the Module 16 challenge we will be working through the following items:
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
In order to complete the first Deliverable a multiple linear regression analysis is performed for each value. This way we can predict which of these variables have the biggest impact on the MPG of the MechaCar. From there, we utilize the <code>summary()</code> function to determine the p-value and r-squared values.

#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The Pr(>|t|) value in the summary image above represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of varaince to the linear model. Keeping that in mind, the larger Pr(>|t|) values are indicitave of affecting the MPG's of the vehicle. So, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and AWD are the most likely to affect the MPG's of the vehicle. Whereas vehicle_length and ground_clearance are likely to have the smallest influence on fuel economy.
####  Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
First off, let us determine the linear model from the summary output. Specifically the Estimate for the Coefficients.

<code>mpg= 6.267vehicle_length + 0.001245vehicle_weight + 0.06877spoiler_angle + 3.546ground_clearance -3.411AWD -104.0 </code>

Based on that, we can not say that the slope of the linear model is considered zero. This is because most of the coefficients for these variables are significant. More importantly, the p-value of 5.35e-11 is much smaller than our p-value of 0.05. This is significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which also means that are slop is non-zero. 
####  Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
To determine this we need to take a look at our r-squared value, which is 0.7149. In other words, 71.49% of the variability of the dependent variable (MPG) can be explained by the linear regression model. This rather high value tells us that the linear model does predict MPG for the MechaCar effectively.

## Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

#### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
Yes and no. When we perform the first an summary table first the entire dataset, the variance of 62.294psi is within the 100psi design specification. However, when we break this data into lots in the second summary, we see a different picture. The variance for Lots 1 and 2 are very much within our design specification, and Lot1 is very impressive. Lot 3 however, shows a variance of 170.286psi. Which is extremely far above our design specification. So I would implore the manufacturing engineers to see what is going on in Lot 3. Is it a staff issue, is the tooling wearing quicker than we expect, or see if there is a totally different issue going on. 

## Deliverable 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils
In Deliverable 3 of the calculation we will perform a T-Test on the all of the lots combined, as well as each lot seperately. This way we will be able to see if there is any of these lots are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 psi. 

![Hopefully another other other other image](https://github.com/jkehm/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/one_sample_t-test_deliv_3.png)

From the above image it is clear that the p-value of 0.06028 is greater than our assumed significane level of 0.05. This means that we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we will accept the null hypothesis. Which means, when looking at all lots combiened the PSI is statistically similar to the population mean of 1,500. 

![Hopefully another other other other other image](https://github.com/jkehm/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/lot_1_t-test_deliv_3.png)

Based on our T-Test on just Lot 1, we return a P-Value of 1. This means that the observed sample mean perfectly matches the presumed population mean of 1,500 PSI. We can conclude that the PSI value for manufacturing lot 2 is exactly 1,500 PSI. 

![Hopefully another other other other other other image](https://github.com/jkehm/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/lot_2_t-test_deliv_3.png)

In our analysis for Lot 2, we are returned a P-Value of 0.6072. Which is larger than our assumed significance levl of 0.05. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The PSI for manufacturing lot is statistically similar to the population mean of 1,500 PSI.

![Hopefully another other other other other other other image](https://github.com/jkehm/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/lot_3_t-test_deliv_3.png)

As we can see from the above T-Test screenshot the P-value is 0.04168, which is less than our assumed significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and must accept the alternative hypothesis. We can say that the PSI for manufacturing lot 3 is statistically not equal to 1,500 PSI. Which supports our conclusion in Deliverable 2. 

## Deliverable 4: Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

In the last section we will design a statistic study to look at other metrics that could be compared to the competition. 

#### What metric will be tested
I believe that the first statistic that people considering a new car look at is the price. So, we will perform a study to take a look into similar vehicles to the MechaCar and compare thier prices. If we can be around the average for the vehcile type, I believe the MechaCar has a much bigger chance of success.
#### Null and Alternative Hypothesis
**H<sub>o</sub>:** The mean value for the cost of any vehicle in this segment is equal.

**H<sub>a</sub>:** At least one of the vehicles in this segment will have a different mean cost. 
#### Statistical Test to be performed
For this we would use an One-Way ANOVA test. This way we can test the mean cost of the MechaCar when compared to its competition. 
#### Data for statistical test is described
We would need the selling cost for different vehicles in the same class at the MechaCar. A dataset of about 5 different cars, as well as the MechaCar should be a sufficient size. And for each model of car, we should find the selling cost of the last 50. This should be a sufficient data size giving us enough information to perform the analysis.
